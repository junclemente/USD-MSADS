# ðŸŽ“ Masters of Science in Applied Data Science - University of San Diego

This repository is a resource hub that I used to collect information that I found helpful while in the MS-ADS program at the University of San Diego. I hope this could also be useful for others who are taking the program.

This repository includes setup guides, environment configuration notes, and course references that I found useful throught the program.

## ðŸ’» VS Code and Windows Development

I used to do development on a Mac but have since replaced my main PCs with Windows-based computers. For the most part, the MSADS program can be done in Windows. In a couple of classes, it's necessary to run _Python_ and _R_ in the same Jupyter Notebook. Unfortunately, this can't be done natively in Windows. Thankfully, Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) makes this possible.

## Custom EDA Library

I started developing my own EDA library since there is a lot of repetitive code when it comes to exploratory data analysis. You can find it here if you want to check it out. Just be aware that it is in active development and it might be a long time between library updates.

You can find that library here: [jcds repository](https://github.com/junclemente/jcds).

This will make the functions useable in the notebook.
