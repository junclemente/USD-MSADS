# ðŸŽ“ Master of Science in Applied Data Science â€” University of San Diego

This repository serves as a resource hub where Iâ€™ve collected information, notes, and configurations that I found helpful during the **Master of Science in Applied Data Science (MS-ADS)** program at the **University of San Diego**. I hope this can also be useful for others currently enrolled in â€” or preparing to start â€” the program.

It includes setup guides, environment configuration notes, and course references that I found most useful throughout my studies.

> ðŸ§  **Note:** Some setup guides in this repository were refined or reformatted with the help of ChatGPT to improve clarity and organization. All technical content is based on my actual configurations and experiences during the program.

## ðŸ’» VS Code and Windows Development

I used to develop primarily on a Mac but have since replaced my main PCs with Windows-based systems. For the most part, the MS-ADS program can be completed entirely in Windows.  

However, in a few classes itâ€™s necessary to run both _Python_ and _R_ in the same Jupyter Notebook â€” something that isnâ€™t supported natively in Windows. Thankfully, **Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)** makes this possible.

Setup guides and references:

- [Setting up WSL2 and VS Code in Windows](setup/vscode_and_wsl2.md)
- [Creating a Conda Environment to Run Python and R in Windows](setup/python_r_windows.md)
- [Exporting Jupyter Notebooks as PDF from VS Code](setup/jnotebook_export_pdf.md)
- [Using Aliases in WSL2](setup/wsl2_aliases.md)
- [Creating and Updating Conda Environments from a YAML File](setup/creating_conda_envs.md)
- [Recommended VS Code Extensions for MS-ADS](setup/vscode_extensions.md)

## ðŸ§© Custom EDA Library

I began developing my own **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** library to simplify repetitive EDA tasks that come up across multiple courses.  
Itâ€™s still in active development, so updates may be infrequent, but itâ€™s already functional for common EDA workflows.

You can check it out here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [**jcds repository**](https://github.com/junclemente/jcds)

Once installed, the libraryâ€™s functions can be imported directly for use within Jupyter Notebooks.
